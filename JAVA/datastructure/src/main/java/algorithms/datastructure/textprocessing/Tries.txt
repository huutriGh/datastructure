Let S be a set of string from aphabet Σ such that no string in S is a prefix of another string.
A standart Trie for S is an ordered tree T with the following properties:

    * Each node T, except root, is labeled with a character of Σ.
    * The children of an internal node of T have distinct labels.
    * T have s leaves, each associated with a string of S, such that the concatenation of labels of the nodes on path from the root to a leaf v of T yields the
      string of S associated with v.
    * The height of T is equal to the length of the longest string S.
    * Every internal node of T has at most |Σ| children.
    * The number of node of T is at most n+1.
The worst case for the number of nodes of a tries occurs when no two strings share a commom noempty prefix
that is, except for the root, all internal nodes have one child.


cons:
    * There is potential space ineffciency in standard Trie: There are potential a lot of nodes that have only one child, 
    and the existence of such nodes is a waste.
