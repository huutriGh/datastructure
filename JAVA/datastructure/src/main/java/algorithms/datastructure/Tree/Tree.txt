* A tree is an abstract data type that stores elements hierarchically. With the exception of the top element, each element in a tree has a parent element and zero or
more children elements.
* The main terminology for tree data structure comes from family trees, with the terms "parent," "child'", "ancestor," and "decendant" being the most common words
   used to describe relationships.
* Each element in a tree has a parent element and zero or more children elements.


Depth of position;
   Root: 0
   Others:  1 + Depth of parent of position
Height of position: is Max Depth of position

============================================================
* Binary Tree
   Is an ordered tree with following properties:
      - Every node has at most two children
      - Each child node is labeled as being a left child or a right child
      - A left child precedes a right child  in order of children of node.
Binary tree have several interestin properties dealing with relationships between their heights and number of nodes.
 Level d has at most 2^d nodes.
 size, isEmpty O(1)
root, parent, isRoot, isInternal, isExternal O(1)
numChildren(p) O(1)
children(p) O(cp +1)
depth(p) O(dp +1)
height O(n)
